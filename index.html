        <h3 class="ultra">Ultra + Nunito</h3>
        <h4>Two chic rounded typefaces</h4>
        <p>Ultra is an ultra bold slab typeface with nods to wood type styles like Clarendon and Egyptian. Strong and dramatic letterforms for titling, a serious, yet friendly, and easily legible typestyle. Perfect for power headlines and titling for impact.</p>
        <p>Nunito is a well balanced sans serif typeface superfamily, with 2 versions: The project began with Nunito, created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography. Jacques Le Bailly extended it to a full set of weights, and an accompanying regular non-rounded terminal version, Nunito Sans.</p>

        <h3 class="playfair">Playfair Display & Alice</h3>
        <h4>A beautiful serif duo</h4>
        <p>Playfair is a transitional design. In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day. Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms.</p>
        <p>Designer of the Alice typeface, Ksenia Erulevich, was inspired by Lewis Carrol's novel and decided to make a typeface that will be suitable for typesetting that book. It came out eclectic and quaint, old-fashioned, having widened proportions, open aperture, and soft rounded features; perfect for long meditative text-setting and headlines.</p>

        <h3 class="lato">Lato with Tenor Sans</h3>
        <h4>Feathery and modern paired</h4>
        <p>Lato's designer Łukasz wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite “transparent” when used in body text but would display some original traits when used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same time, he created a sleek sans serif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato was designed in 2010. The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. “Male and female, serious but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,” says Łukasz.</p>
        <p>Tenor Sans is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Denis Masharov. Intended for the setting of body text, it can also be applied to headlines. Optimized for print and web, it has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms. It contains an extended Latin and extended Cyrillic alphabets, Western and Central European, Cyrillic, Turkish, Baltic, Icelandic and Celtic.</p>
